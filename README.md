# 💼 Fajri Ilham Mughni – Data Science & Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Fajri, a data enthusiast with a background in geological engineering. I apply data-driven approaches to explore complex development issues — including social inequality, indigenous land governance in Indonesia, data management in the oil and gas industry, and shifting narratives in policy and society.

This repository showcases selected projects that intersect **data science**, **social-ecological systems**, and **critical development questions**.
